- How do i intercept and display axios errors with sanctum?
- app.ts complains about the type of the routes
- do i filter with the store or the controller?
- should i create another domain called auth?


- how do i make it reload the resources after login?
- there is a modal, but no bootstrap
-   The function for checking if someone is logged blocks everything
-   It does not redirect
-   It does not reload the tickets when you log in
-   It does load the tickets when you log out though
-   I needed to add .data to the data from the controllers. It does not seem to unwrap. Why? --- solved boot() methode in je AppServiceProvider : JsonResource::withoutWrapping();

---------------------------------------
-   How to make the tickets reload?
-   Only one category per ticket? Multiple
-   Can normal users post comments? Yes
-   What is the difference between notes and comments? Only who sees them?
-   Do i need the timestamps on everything? yes
-   Where do i put the store for the login? AuthController?
-   If you are having trouble authenticating with your application from an SPA that executes on a separate subdomain, what does that mean??
